Hi! Welcome. I don't know what this site will become, but I'm glad you're along for the ride.

I am a `programmer` by day and a writer by night. I love fantasy, sci-fi, romance, and coming of age stories so that's likely what you'll find on here. This is my first time trying a blog, posting my writing, or anything of the sort. Most posts will probably be rough and draft-like, though I may go back and edit old stories. If you like my stories, have any tips, or just want to say hi, toss me an email.

Here we go! :)
