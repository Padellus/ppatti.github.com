My name is Phillip Edward. I live in San Francisco right now, wrapped up in the tech scene. On the weekends I hide in from the world with my boyfriend and we write, cook, watch movies, eat pizza, and build computery things. Feel feel to drop me an email (in the footer)!

Some things I like:
* Writing. Mostly fantasy, sci-fi, and romance. Yes, I am a sap
* Tech, programming, cyberspace, and the interwebs
* Mindfulness and learning new things
* Music. Alternative, strings, ambient, electronic
* Dogs. Want a husky ASAP
